            My creative career began in the early nineties, when a happy young
            Gun drew an absolute garbage drawing that my kindergarten teacher
            praised like the Mona Lisa. It was taped onto the refrigerator and
            my fate seemed sealed.

            20 years and two post-graduate educations later, I did become an
            illustrator and animator. In 2015, I started freelancing full-time.
            After a few years, I realised that I wanted to work in a team and
            with something more technical and problem solving. Finding code felt
            like the last puzzle piece.

            In August 2020, I started studying full-time to become a front-end
            developer. When Iâ€™m not glued to my computer, I build{" "}
