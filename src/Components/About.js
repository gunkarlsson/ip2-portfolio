          My creative career began in the early nineties, when a happy young Gun
          drew an absolute garbage drawing that my kindergarten teacher praised
          like the Mona Lisa. It was taped onto the refrigerator and my fate
          seemed sealed. {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          20 years and two post-graduate educations later, I did become an
          illustrator and animator. In 2015, I started freelancing full-time.
          After a few years, I realised that I wanted to work in a team and with
          something more technical and problem solving. Finding code felt like
          the last puzzle piece. {"\n"}
          {"\n"}
          In August 2020, I started studying full-time to become a front-end
          developer. When Iâ€™m not glued to my computer, I build{" "}
          <span className="hover-text">wonky furniture</span> and carve spoons.{" "}
